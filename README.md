# ⚙️ Python Algorithms — A Curated Reference Vault

This repository hosts a well-organized, auto-generated collection of **Python algorithm notes and implementations**, designed to help with:

- 🧠 Interview prep and revision
- 📚 Core algorithm understanding
- 🛠️ System design and low-level optimization thinking

Each algorithm is explained clearly, with runnable Python implementations and structured documentation — ideal for self-study or knowledge reinforcement.

## 📄 What's Inside Each File?

Every algorithm file contains:

- Algorithm category/type
- Core intuition and flow
- Time & space complexity table
- Variants and trade-offs
- Classic use cases and pitfalls
- Code implementation in Python

Example (from `binary_search_algo.py`):

```python
# 2. Core Idea / Intuition
"""
Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing a sorted array in half, checking the midpoint.
"""

def binary_search(arr, target):
    ...
```
