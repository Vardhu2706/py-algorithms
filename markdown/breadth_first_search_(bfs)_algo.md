# Breadth First Search (BFS) Algorithm

## 1. Category / Type
"""
Breadth First Search (BFS) is a fundamental algorithm used for graph traversal and searching. It falls under the category of graph algorithms and is commonly used to explore nodes and edges of a graph.
"""

## 2. Core Idea / Intuition
"""
The core idea of BFS is to explore the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be explored. BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph and for exploring all the nodes reachable from a given node.
"""

## 3. Steps / Flow
"""
1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node, marking it as visited.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a node from the queue.
   - Process the dequeued node (usually involves recording its value or performing some operation).
   - Enqueue all its adjacent, unvisited nodes, marking them as visited.
3. Repeat the process until the queue is empty.
"""

## 4. Time & Space Complexity
"""
| Best    | Average | Worst   | Space   |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| O(V+E)  | O(V+E)  | O(V+E)  | O(V)    |

- V is the number of vertices.
- E is the number of edges.
- The time complexity is O(V+E) because every vertex and every edge will be explored in the worst case.
- The space complexity is O(V) due to the additional storage required for the queue and the visited set.
"""

## 5. Use Cases
"""
BFS is used in:
- Shortest path finding in unweighted graphs.
- Crawling the web: BFS can be used by web crawlers to explore pages.
- Finding all connected components in a graph.
- Level-order traversal in trees.
"""

## 6. Common Variants
"""
- Bidirectional BFS: Used to reduce the search space by simultaneously exploring from both the start and target nodes.
- Multi-source BFS: Initiates BFS from multiple sources simultaneously.
- Layered BFS: Used in network flow algorithms like Dinic's algorithm.
"""

## 7. Trade-offs
"""
- BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, whereas DFS can get trapped exploring a deep node path.
- BFS can consume more memory than DFS, especially if the graph has a large breadth.
- BFS is not suitable for graphs with edge weights; algorithms like Dijkstra's are more appropriate in such cases.
"""

## 8. Pitfalls / Gotchas
"""
- Ensure all nodes are marked as visited to prevent infinite loops.
- BFS may not be feasible in extremely large graphs due to memory constraints.
- It is important to correctly handle graph structures (e.g., adjacency list vs adjacency matrix) to optimize performance.
"""

## 9. Classic Problems
"""
- Shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- Solving puzzles like Rubik's Cube or the 15-puzzle where states can be represented as graphs.
- Finding all nodes within one connected component in a graph.
"""

## 10. Code Implementation (Demo)
def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = []

    # Initialize the BFS with the start node
    queue.append(start)
    visited.add(start)

    while queue:
        # Dequeue a vertex from the queue
        current = queue.pop(0)
        print(current, end=" ")

        # Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex current
        # If an adjacent vertex has not been visited, then mark it visited and enqueue it
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)

# Example usage:
# Define a graph using an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

# Perform BFS starting from node 'A'
bfs(graph, 'A')
```
